# PROJECT 4.2: HEART DISEASE DIAGNOSTIC PART 2
---------------------------------------------------
## 1. GENERAL
In the previous section, we laid the “foundations” for the heart disease prediction problem: understanding the Cleveland data structure, standardizing the preprocessing process, applying feature generation techniques, and building basic Machine Learning (ML) models such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and even testing a basic ensemble variant. The results show that traditional models, when trained with carefully processed data, can achieve encouraging performance and help us understand the problem quite effectively.
## 2. DATA TYPE
The dataset used in this Project is based on the Cleveland Heart Disease. The Database includes the medical information of 303 patient with 13 input features as following snapshot table:
